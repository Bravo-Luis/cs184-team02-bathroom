Scribed Discussion:

Today we finished our problem scenarios and then went over the different features that we want to implement into our app. We also talked about meeting tomorrow outside of class to discuss making the first instance of our project and then pushing it to Git Hub so we can have the whole group working on it. We also worked on our ReadMe and our Licensing.
