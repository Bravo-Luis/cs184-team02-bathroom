## Action item

* a goal: identify something the team wants to get better at
* a change/experiment: identify one thing that the team will change about how it works together
* a measurement: identify at least one way to measure whether the change helped the team achieve the goal, or move closer to it.

Goal: Better communication outside of class time
Experiment: Daily check-ins on discord about the progress or blockers
Measurement: Everyone has a similar understanding on where we are as a group. We can also all discuss how we feel about the progres and communication.

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.
* A brief assessment of how it went.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today?

we used the Start/Stop/Continue process, and I believe it was quite effective. It allowed us to gain a clearer understanding of where each group member is facing challenges and where they're excelling. Many valuable points were raised during the discussion, and it was notable that several comments were similar across the team. This indicates that we share common concerns and recognize the same strengths within the group. One suggestion for the next retro leader would be to allocate more time for the "Stop" section. Teams often focus less on this compared to "Start" or "Continue," but diving deeper into what we should stop doing can be crucial for improving our workflow.
