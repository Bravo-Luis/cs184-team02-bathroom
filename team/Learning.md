# Benefits of Swift

- Apple developed APIs
- Xcode's preview feature allows developers to see changes in real-time, speeding up the development process.
- Native IOS which will integrate easier
- SwiftUI is cross-platform across Apple devices (iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS), allowing for a single codebase with adjustments for different platforms.

# Challenges of Swift

- Apple development fee
- All novices with Swift
- Not cross-platform
- SwiftUI is only supported in iOS 13 and later, limiting its use in apps that need to support older iOS versions.
- Less resources since SwiftUI is relatively newer
- XCode is more complicated than a normal IDE
